# Guess-The-Celebrity-Fun-App
This is one of the personal projects made for fun!

This project involves <b><i>Web Scraping</i></b>.By using html code of a page of a website (<i>Top 100 celebrities photos and their names</i>),I downloaded that html content on app start,splitting and finaly getting the celeb photo url and their name by use of Pattern and Matcher in Java.Then presenting it to the users as shown below as a fun game!
